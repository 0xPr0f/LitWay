# LITWAY
LITDWAY DAO is a DAO for content(NFT) creators, that only the DAO members are entitled to create nfts and other users can simply only buy them, but if the project will be open, there need to be some form of authentication, with the LITDWAY authentication system you can verify that you own the dao nft token and can proceed to the site.   
  
p.s LITWAY and LITDWAY are kind of the same thing and can be use interchangeably here
# How it works
The authentication system has three stages:  
  
Stage 1: Confirm the athenticating address by signing a message.  
Stage 2: Request a JWT which will be displayed on the app.  
Stage 3: Access the protect LITDWAY content(NFT) creator site.    
    
And there is a reset button to clear your previous entries and begin a new one.  
# Draw back  
There was not enough time to explore the DAO site more, but if this is need i will be able to do a seperate video for this, you can join my discord so i can get your feedback.  
# How it was built  
LITWAY was built using the lit-protocol-js-sdk that enables users to easily token gate any content of their choice with simple javascript.  
The authentication code is in the example.html, while the server code is in the server.js, the locked app(react build) is in client\MainWork which will show the build and the app codes.  
To run the code, in the folder where ther is a package.json you will use `yarn` to install the dependencies and then you can start up the app at localhost, but you will need the nft purchased to access the site, so you can head to my discord and you will be provided the assistance need.  
# Use case
This authentication system has different use case.  
Use case 1: This authentication can be used to secure DApp to be accessed by specific nft/collection holders which can be a DAO.  
  
Use case 2: This authentication can be used as a mean of airdrop distribution, for users to be able to access the claim site if they are a DAO(particular NFT holder) or if they are a particular token holders.   
  
Use case 3(my use case): I used this authentication to secure a NFT minter that allows only certain NFT holder(member of the LITWAY DAO) to access this site and Mint/create NFT to be sold on the market place, Non-members can only purchase the NFTS been created.
